Handlers:
===========================

In ansible playbook, we may have some tasks which are to be executed only on need basis/when reuqired - not always

Whenever a code file is placed on the home directory of webservers, we will need to restart webserver/appserver

We create tasks for restarting the appserver/webserver.

However these tasks doesnot need to be executed always. They are execute only if code file has chnaged

Certain set of tasks can be executed only when its parent task status has changed

Ansible - Handlers Section and notify keyword

> handlers section in a playbook, also consist of tasks
> But these tasks will get executed only when notified by a parent task
> Handler task and notify keyword work hand in hand
> If parent task status = changed, it will notify the handler task to get executed
> If parent task status = ok, it will not notify the handler task for executed
> with notify keyword -> handlers tasks name should be given as is.
> You can have multiple handler tasks
> notify keyword can notify multiple handlers
> In ansible, handler tasks eventough notified earlier, will only get executed at the end of the playbook

However we can use a module called as - meta with parameter as flush_handlers

Immediatly the notified  handler task will run/execute. it will not wait for execution till the end

> If ansible playbook failes, the notified handlers will not be executed

But if we still want hadnlers to run, irrespective of failed playbook then use the flag --force-handlers

# ansible-playbook playbookName.yml --force-handlers

Jinja2 template:
=============================================



What is a template:

Template is a simple file which consist of:

  > text
  > dynamic variables ( variable whocse value changes as per every host)-> fact variables
  > static variables ( variable whocse value remain same for every host)--> custom variables
  > comments
  > loop conditions, if consition
  > arguments/filters

Jinja2 is a way to write templates in Ansible

***
> Becuase of Jinja2 template, it is easy to do configurations unique to every server
> These templates change content of the file as per every servers fact
> These Jinja2 templates when executed by ansible will compute variable values in real time and then copy the file on every server
> With jinja2 template we make use of TEMPLATE module of ansibleto copy the Jinja2 file
> Jinja2 templates will ahve extension as .j2

 template name will be ==> file1.txt.j2  when copied on host server ==> file1.txt

template name will be ==>index.html.j2==> when copied on host server ==> index.html 

template name will be ==> file1.j2

template name will be ==> file1.conf.j2


===========================================

Whenever ansible runs a playbook with template module, it will look for jinja2 template in the current directory

In jinja2 template, if we have refer/call a custom or fact variable we use {{ variablename }}
