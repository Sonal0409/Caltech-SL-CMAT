=======================

Continue with the set up of ansible and worker node

Ansible controller (master Node) will have to set up so as to communicate with Worker1 and worker 2 using user as ansiuser

On the master Node of the lab

> generate ssh keys for user ansiuser

command:

# sudo hostname AnsibleController
# sudo su -
# su - ansiuser
# ssh-keygen

press ENTER key 3 times

SSH key will be genereated


> Copy The SSH key of Ansible Controller (MASTER NODE) on Worker 1 using user ansiuser

> Copy The SSH key of Ansible Controller (MASTER NODE) on Worker 2 using user ansiuser


Inventory file of ansible

1. To check if Ansible controller can communicate with Worker1 and worker2


Defult inventory file:

/etc/ansible

# sudo vim hosts


In this host file we can add the ipaddress in various formats:

Method 1: Ungrouped hosts

172.31.6.107
172.31.5.18

Now we will use ansible ping module which will ping the the ipaddress and show us if the connection successfull or not


Ansible adhoc command for ungrouped hosts in inventory file:

Syntax:

# ansible ipaddressofhost -m ping

Example2: pass multiple ipaddress in the command

# ansible ipaddr:ippaddr2  -m ping


Method 2: grouped hosts

# create a group

[worker1]
172.31.6.107

[worker2]
172.31.5.18

[webserver]
172.31.5.18
172.31.6.107


Ansible adhoc command for grouped hosts in inventory file:

Syntax:

# ansible groupname -m ping


method 3: Creating subgroups inside a main group

in this ansible will ping ipaddress of each group mentioned under main group

[worker1]
172.31.6.107


[worker2]
172.31.5.18


[webserver]
172.31.5.18
172.31.6.107

[allinfra:children]
worker1
worker2
webserver


# ansible allinfra -m ping


============================

Can we execute ansible commands from any directory fo your system  ==> Yes

How does ansible get the inventory information/host file info

In the ansible.cfg file we have a default parameter "inventory" whose value /etc/ansible/hosts

In realtime, we have many users who will be using ACM

We may have different application for which seperats host/inventory file are needed


DEMO : Create our own inventory file in the current user directory and also update the ansible.cfg file with inventory location


> Creating a custom static inventory file


Demo: Create an ansible.cfg file where you mention ansible to look for inventory file in the current directory

# ansible webserver -m ping

> Always ansible will look for the group hosts/inventoryfile webserver in the current user directory first, if you dont have file in current directory, then its looks for host group in /etc/ansible/hosts

=================================

EXTRA DEMO:
===============================
Currently in our setup

we have 3 VM - ubuntu OS - SL lab - same network

Create a EC2 server on AWS and add it to your inventory file and see if ansible controller is able to communicate to it or not


Execute the module on all the groups in the inventory file:

# ansible all -m ping


==================================================

Ad-hoc Commands in Ansible:
======================================================
> These are single line commands
> These command start with the keyword ansible
> These commands can exeucte one module at a time on the host servers
> In these command you mention the groupname/hostip
> These command are useful when we have to exeucte something quickly on the hosts server
> Whenever we want to check some information on hostservers, adhoc commands are used
>These commands are not suitable to repetative activites.
> If we have to run linux command, shell commands run quickly on host servers to check output , check status service we cna use adhoc commands.
> These commands are not suitable for running set of tasks, for this we use Playbooks

Syntax of adhoc command:

# ansible hostgroupName -m modulename -a "attribute1=value"

-m = module name

-a = argument to be passed to the module


File Module:
=====================
his module will create/delete files and directories

 Parameters to be given:

 1. path => destination on host servers where file/directory has to be created

 2. state =>
Choices:
absent   ==> in the given path delete the file or directory
directory ==> in the given path create a new directory if not present
file ==>in the given path create a new file if not present
touch => in the given path create a new empty file if not present

3. owner

4. group

5. mode

I will user a new user labsuser
copy its ssh key on the worker1

Create your own ansible.cfg file we will write parameters

[defualts]
inventory= ./myinventory
remote_user= labsuser
ask_pass=true
host_key_checking=false
forks=2
[privilege_escalation]
become=true
become_user=root
